# ERC404Meme: Next-gen Hybrid Memecoin Standard

ERC404Meme is an opionated yet practical reimplementation of the legacy [ERC404](https://github.com/Pandora-Labs-Org/erc404) standard, designed to enhance the functionality of real-world memecoin projects by integrating them with the robust features of NFTs.

## Introduction

ERC404 combines the features of ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens). ERC404Meme expands upon this foundation by enabling the creation of generative PFP NFT collections directly tied to memecoins, thus adding significant value and utility to each token.

## Key Features

- **Generative PFP NFTs**: Each ERC404Meme token is part of a vast generative PFP NFT collection, providing unique character and identity to memecoins.
- **Enhanced Liquidity and Fractionalization**: Supports native liquidity on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, which enhances market fluidity and accessibility.
- **Modular Architecture**: Adopts the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) for modular design and efficient contract management.
- **Secure and Transparent Processes**: Utilizes Chainlink's VRF and Automation tools to ensure fairness and reliability in token generation and NFT reveals.

## Distinctions from Legacy ERC404

- **Legacy ERC404**: Combines ERC721 and ERC20, where each token equals one NFT.
- **ERC404Meme**: Merges generative PFPs with memecoins, where 10,000 tokens represent one NFT, utilizing Chainlink VRF for randomization and Automation for operational efficiency.


## How It Works

1. **Token Generation**: Each token corresponds to a unique PFP NFT with specific traits.
2. **Minting and Trading**: Tokens are minted and can be traded on decentralized exchanges, providing immediate liquidity and fractional ownership.
3. **Reveal Process**: NFT traits are securely and randomly revealed using Chainlink's VRF and Automation, enhancing user engagement and trust.
4. **Dynamic Interaction**: Tokens can be used within the ERC404 ecosystem for various interactions and transactions, providing a rich, user-centric experience.
